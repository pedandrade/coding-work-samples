    "The idea of this analysis was to get an idea of the trending topics regarding the World Cup in Qatar, which is happening this year in November/December. Using the concepts and technical skills we learned in class, through Python Programming Language and Analysis, I could access Reddit's API (Step 1) and collect data on the hottest posts on the 'worldculp' subreddit - https://www.reddit.com/r/worldcup/ (Step 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting some parameters like the number of posts, comments and subcomments, we collected the data and saved it in a json file, that was letter read using Python, so I could perform the analysis (Step 3). On this stage, I structured the data collected into a data frame using pandas and performed a text cleaning using a user defined function (text_clean). \n",
    "\n",
    "Analyzing then the new cleaned text after adding some other stop words to the list created, I could see that the most frequent used words and bigrams (keyphrases) were related to tickets, accommodations in Qatar (hotels, fan villages). Reddit is being used as a marketplace for tickets to the 2022 World Cup, where users are trying to find other users who are selling or buying game tickets for specific games of countries like Uruguay, Saudi Arabia, Argentina, Costa Rica, US. Interesting to notice is that most of those countries are not really traditional or top ranked teams (except Argentine or Uruguay) so through this we can make sense of the location of some users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another trending topic is the Hayya Card, which is the official Fan ID of the World Cup. Users are interested on getting more information on the application process, or even buying cards through Reddit. What is interesting to notice is that when analyzing the word Hayya by itself, it can mislead you into another insight. Hayya is the name of the World Cup theme song, so using the Bigram function was crucial to get a context of the word.\n",
    "\n",
    "World Cup game tickets are hard to get, being the process very long and you must count with a little bit of luck, since it works in a lottery format. So, as conclusion of this analysis, the main takeaway is that if you are interested in going to the World Cup, Reddit and the subreddit 'worldcup' might be a good place to look for tickets, places to stay and other information related to the event. Also, if you are one of the lucky ones who were able to get the tickets but unfortunately can not go the event, Reddit is a good platform to find possible buyers and make extra money selling the tickets based on the high demand.\n",
