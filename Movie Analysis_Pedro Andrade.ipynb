Looking at the IMDB Score and User Rating, we see that the average and the median score are very close, being the average (mean) a little smaller than the central value (median) of all scores in these two variables. The two graphs show exactly that, being the chart on the left the Average User Rating and the one on the right the average of IMDB Score.

Interesting to notice that most of the data is concentrated between 0 and 250,000 votes (0.25*10^6) and 0 and $100,000,000 (1*10^8) in gross earnings, but after that is shows a slightly positive trend line, increasing while both variables are increasing as well.

    "It is interesting to notice that the genre sports have smaller budgets when compared to the average budget of all the other movies on this dataset. But that does not mean that sports movies do not make money in the end. In fact that is completely the opposite. The average gross earning of sports movies represents 66% more of their original budget! That means that for every dollar spent on the production of the movie, the movie generates 1.66 dollars in total revenue. The other movie genres only generates 1.04 per dollar spent, only four percent of their initial budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can definitely say that sports movies are much more cost efficient, generating more money per dollar spent that all the other movies. Sports genre are an interesting option to invest when deciding to produce a new movie!"

    "# Insight #2 and #3 - Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a trend and people are talking about them. Sports movies are becoming more and more popular and are part of the American society and culture. As Bonnet(2017) said, \"Nowadays, the belief in sports’ social role is still lasting: it is thought to bolster the teaching of and respect for values which are essential to Americanness, such as competitiveness, equal opportunities, or social mobility.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "Firestein (2007) defined: \"Sports are part of the very fabric of American life, discourse, and lexicon [...]. The centrality of sports in American life is amply reflected in contemporary American cinema, (with) films featuring virtually every major sport, from football, basketball, baseball, and hockey, to boxing, horse racing, and even surfing.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "These explain exactly why sports movies have higher scores, both at the IMDB website and User Ratings. When we look at the numbers, sports movie IMDB scores average 6.94 (out of 10) while the average of all movies is only 6.45. Users also evaluate sports movie better in average, rating 7.07, when the average of all movies is 6.41. \n",
    "\n",
    "Not only that. The numbers also confirm the preference for real-life stories, as the sports movies based on biographies have higher IMDB Score and User Ratings than the other sub-genres of sports and the average of all movies! For example the movie \"42\", a Biography/Sport movie released in 2013, in the US. The movie is about a baseball player called Jackie Robinson, who was the first black athlete to play in Major League Baseball in the modern era (late 19th and early 20th centuries). \n",
    "\n",
    "This by itself brings a lot of social themes to debate, especially in context that we are still battling racial issues in the 21st century, more than 70 years later! \"42\" has a rating of 7.5, both at IMDB and User Ratings, comparing to 6.94 (Sports IMDB average) and 7.07(User Rating Sports average). \n",
    "\n",
    "When movies addresses social issues, it seems to create a sort of a mirror reflecting real-life and bringing important values to discussion in an entertaining way. Sports movies can easily address these issues in many ways, like resilience, patience, willingness to achieve goals, hard work and many other, through the lifes of many athletes and sports references in many different sports. \n"

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "After all these analysis, it is noticeable that Sports Movies are an interesting way to connect to the audience and fans of movies, at the same time entertaining and addressing real-life conflicts and social issues. They can be a powerful tool to change people's mindset on many issues, teaching valuable lessons on ethics, resilience, respect, humility, and many other principles that build character. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is also a profitable segment, since a small budget can turn into a source of good revenue if the history is well built and portrayed. The audience love a good story, based on a real-life situation or character with a strong and beautiful message behind, that can be applied or used as motivation out from the screen. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a rock climber and footballer and above all, a great sports fan, I love to watch movie about sports and I truly believe that sports can teach us great lessons, and I wish there were more movies related to it to make a more impactful analysis, with more examples to compare and get more insights.
